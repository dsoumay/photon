In Photon OS version 4.0 onwards, the security advisories for the updated RPMs are available in the respective repositories. To see more details about all the published security advisories, use the `updateinfo` option in the `tdnf` command. To see the entire list of the security advisories, enable both the repositories.
 

**Notes**: The number of security advisories that you see in the message of the day is only for the enabled repository and might not refer to the total number of advisories.
