You can set `systemd-networkd` to work in debug mode so that you can analyze log files with debugging information to help troubleshoot networking problems. 

The following procedure turns on network debugging by adding a drop-in file in `/etc/systemd` to customize the default systemd configuration in `/usr/lib/systemd`.

1. Run the following command as root to create a directory with this exact name, including the `.d` extension:
	
	```console
	mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service.d/
	```

1. Run the following command as root to establish a systemd drop-in unit with a debugging configuration for the network service:

    ```console
    cat > /etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service.d/10-loglevel-debug.conf << "EOF"
    \[Service\]
    Environment=SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug
    EOF
    ```
 
1. Reload the `systemctl` daemon and restart the `systemd-networkd` service for the changes to take effect:
	
    ```console
    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl restart systemd-networkd
    ```

1. Verify that your changes took effect:
	
	```console
	systemd-delta --type=extended
	```

1. View the log files by running this command:
	```console
	journalctl -u systemd-networkd
	```

1. After debugging the network connections, turn debugging off by deleting the drop-in file:

	```console
   	rm /etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service.d/10-loglevel-debug.conf
	```
